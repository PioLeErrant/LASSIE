# Test models

This directory of the repository contains the synthetic models used to assess LASSIE's computational efficiency.
The directory contains two files:
* LASSIEmodels.zip: this file contains all the synthetic models used in the paper. **Warning**: the whole archive requires approximately 12 GB when uncompressed; 
* copasi_test_4096x4096.sbml: this SBML file describes a biochemical model characterized by 4096 chemical reactions involving 4096 species. The model shows that COPASI might crash when a large-scale simulation is attempted.
